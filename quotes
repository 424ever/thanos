You're strong, but I could snap my fingers and you'd all
cease to exist.
%
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
%
I'm a survivor.
%
You should have gone for the head.
%
You could not live with your own failure, and where did that
bring you? Back to me.
%
I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that
you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening.
Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it.
Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's
here. Or should I say, I am.
%
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
%
Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe.
But this ... does put a smile on my face.

Thanos: Daughter.
Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes
Gamora: What did it cost?
Thanos: Everything.
%
You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity
will still be alive. I hope they remember you.
%
Thanos: Stark.
Tony Stark: You know me?
Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
Tony Stark: My only curse is you.
%
I used the stones to destroy the stones. And it nearly killed
me. But the work is done, it always will be.
I am ... inevitable.
%
This universe is finite, its resources, finite.
%
I ignored my destiny once, I can not do that again. Even for
you. I'm sorry, little one.
%
The universe required correction. After that, the stones
served no purpose beyond temptation.
%
Fine. I'll do it myself.
%
With all six stones, I can simply snap my fingers, they
would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.
%
You're strong. Me ... You're generous. Me ... But I never
taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. Where is
the Soul Stone?
%
You should choose your words more carefully.
%
Going to bed hungry. Scrounging for scraps. Your planet was
on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You
know what’s happened since then? The children born have known
nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It’s a paradise.
%
The end is near.
%
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
